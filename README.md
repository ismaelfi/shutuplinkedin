# ü§´ ShutUpLinkedIn

A smart Chrome extension that automatically detects and hides low-value, engagement-bait posts on LinkedIn. It uses pattern recognition, heuristics, and lightweight AI to clean up your feed ‚Äî so you only see content that's genuinely worth your time.

Instead of manually muting people or scrolling endlessly through clout-chasing nonsense, ShutUpLinkedIn does it for you. Quietly. Relentlessly. Automatically.

## Features

- **Smart Detection**: Uses advanced pattern recognition to identify engagement bait, humble bragging, fake stories, and motivational spam
- **Configurable Aggressiveness**: Choose from Low, Medium, or High filtering levels based on your preferences
- **Non-Destructive**: Hidden posts can always be revealed with a click if you want to see them
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally in your browser - no data is sent to external servers
- **Lightweight**: Minimal performance impact on LinkedIn's interface
- **Real-time Stats**: Track how many low-value posts have been filtered from your feed

## What Gets Filtered

ShutUpLinkedIn detects and hides posts containing:

### Engagement Bait
- "Agree?" / "Thoughts?" posts
- "Am I the only one who..." questions
- "Unpopular opinion" / "Hot take" statements
- "Change my mind" challenges

### Humble Bragging
- "Blessed to announce..."
- "Humbled to share..."
- "Grateful to announce..."

### Generic Motivational Spam
- Life lesson posts
- "Success secrets" and "millionaire mindset" content
- Generic inspirational quotes without context
- Excessive motivational buzzwords

### Low-Value Indicators
- Excessive emoji usage
- All-caps words and excessive punctuation
- Corporate buzzword soup (synergy, disrupt, leverage, etc.)
- Fake urgency ("Act now!", "Limited time!")

### Fake Stories
- Obviously fabricated personal anecdotes
- "True story" markers
- "You won't believe what happened" posts

## How It Works

ShutUpLinkedIn uses a multi-layered approach to content analysis:

1. **Pattern Matching**: Regex patterns detect common engagement bait phrases
2. **Heuristic Analysis**: Examines post structure, length, punctuation patterns
3. **Content Scoring**: Assigns spam scores based on multiple factors
4. **Threshold Filtering**: Hides posts above configured spam threshold
5. **User Override**: Always allows manual revelation of hidden content

## FAQ

**Q: Will this break LinkedIn's functionality?**
A: No, the extension only hides posts visually. All LinkedIn features continue to work normally.

**Q: Can I see what was hidden?**
A: Yes! Each hidden post shows a preview and "Show anyway" button to reveal the full content.

**Q: Does this affect my LinkedIn algorithm?**
A: No, posts are only hidden visually. LinkedIn's algorithm doesn't know the extension exists.

**Q: Can I customize what gets filtered?**
A: Currently you can adjust the aggressiveness level. Custom rules are planned for a future update.
